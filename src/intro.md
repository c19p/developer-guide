# Introduction

Hello again! We're excited to see you here and are hoping you have a productive journey in extending the C19 protocol.

This book will guide you through the steps for implementing the different layers of the C19 protocol and will show you the details and internals 
of the project so you could add capabilities that might be missing for you to complete your layer implementations.

**It is imperative** that you first read the [User Guide] and get yourself familiar with being a user of the C19 protocol. 
This book will repeat some of the information that is presented in the user guide, but it's not a good replacement for the knowledge you will 
gain by using and reading the user guide.

So let's begin! Enjoy and have a save journey :)
